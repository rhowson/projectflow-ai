# Phase Filter Carousel Implementation - Update Notes

## Overview
Updated the phase filter on the project/task screen from a dropdown approach to a horizontal carousel with cards for better user experience.

## New Implementation Features
- **Horizontal scrollable carousel** with phase cards
- **Visual phase status indicators** with color-coded icons
- **Clear selection states** with highlighted selected cards
- **Task count display** for each phase
- **Swipe indicator** for projects with many phases
- **Inline clear button** when filter is active

## Current Implementation
- Method: `_buildPhaseCarousel()` + `_buildPhaseCard()`
- Location: `tasks_screen.dart` around line 388
- Replaces: `_buildCompactPhaseFilterSection()` (still preserved)
- Called from: Line 96 in main build method

## Design Specifications
- **Card width**: 140.w (consistent carousel sizing)
- **Card height**: 100.h (optimal for mobile)
- **Horizontal spacing**: 12.w between cards
- **Status colors**: Purple (in progress), Green (completed), Orange (on hold), Gray (not started)
- **Icons**: select_all (All Phases), view_module_outlined (individual phases)

## Key Features
1. **"All Phases" card** always first in carousel
2. **Status-based coloring** for phase icons
3. **Selection feedback** with check icons and color changes  
4. **Touch-friendly sizing** optimized for mobile interaction
5. **Smooth horizontal scrolling** with proper padding
6. **Visual hierarchy** with clear typography

## Rollback Instructions
To revert to dropdown approach:

1. In `tasks_screen.dart` line 96, change:
```dart
_buildPhaseCarousel(selectedProject),
```
Back to:
```dart
_buildCompactPhaseFilterSection(selectedProject),
```

2. Original methods are preserved as:
- `_buildCompactPhaseFilterSection()` (line 290)
- `_showPhaseSelector()` (line 605)
- `_buildPhaseOption()` (line 647)

## Benefits of New Approach
- **Better discoverability** - All phases visible at once
- **Faster interaction** - No modal/dropdown delays  
- **Visual feedback** - Clear status indicators and selection states
- **Mobile-optimized** - Touch-friendly card interaction
- **Reduced cognitive load** - No need to remember phase names

## Files Modified
- `lib/features/tasks/presentation/tasks_screen.dart`

The new carousel provides a much more intuitive and visually appealing way to filter tasks by project phase.
