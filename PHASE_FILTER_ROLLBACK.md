# Phase Filter Implementation - Rollback Instructions

## Overview
The phase filter in the tasks screen has been redesigned to be more compact and user-friendly. The original implementation has been preserved for easy rollback if needed.

## New Implementation Features
- **Compact single-row design** instead of multi-row wrap layout
- **Dropdown-style selector** instead of exposed filter chips
- **Modal bottom sheet** for phase selection
- **Reduced vertical space** (~60px savings)
- **Improved UX** with clear visual feedback

## Current Implementation
- Method: `_buildCompactPhaseFilterSection()`
- Called from: `tasks_screen.dart` line 96
- Modal: `_showPhaseSelector()` method
- Option widget: `_buildPhaseOption()` method

## Rollback Process

### Step 1: Revert Method Call
In `lib/features/tasks/presentation/tasks_screen.dart` around line 96:

**Change:**
```dart
_buildCompactPhaseFilterSection(selectedProject),
```

**Back to:**
```dart
_buildPhaseFilterSection_ORIGINAL(selectedProject),
```

### Step 2: Update Method Name
Find the method `_buildPhaseFilterSection_ORIGINAL()` around line 544 and rename it:

**Change:**
```dart
Widget _buildPhaseFilterSection_ORIGINAL(Project selectedProject) {
```

**Back to:**
```dart
Widget _buildPhaseFilterSection(Project selectedProject) {
```

### Step 3: Restore Spacing
Around line 99, change the spacing back:

**Change:**
```dart
SizedBox(height: 16.h), // Reduced from 24.h
```

**Back to:**
```dart
SizedBox(height: 24.h),
```

### Step 4: Clean Up (Optional)
Remove the following methods if no longer needed:
- `_buildCompactPhaseFilterSection()`
- `_showPhaseSelector()`
- `_buildPhaseOption()`

## Files Modified
- `lib/features/tasks/presentation/tasks_screen.dart`

## Verification
After rollback, verify:
1. Phase filter displays as chip-based wrap layout
2. All phases are visible inline
3. Filter functionality works correctly
4. No compilation errors

## Notes
- The original implementation is preserved as `_buildPhaseFilterSection_ORIGINAL`
- No data models or providers were modified
- Rollback can be completed in < 5 minutes
- Both implementations maintain the same functionality
